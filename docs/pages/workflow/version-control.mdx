# Version Control Guidelines

Effective version control is essential for collaborative development. At Hyperscan, we use Git as our version control system and follow these guidelines to maintain a clean, organized codebase.

## Branching Strategy

We follow a modified GitFlow workflow:

- **main** - Production-ready code
- **develop** - Integration branch for features
- **feature/*** - New features and non-emergency bug fixes
- **release/*** - Release preparation
- **hotfix/*** - Emergency fixes for production

### Branch Naming Conventions

- **feature/[issue-id]-short-description** (e.g., `feature/HS-123-add-user-authentication`)
- **hotfix/[issue-id]-short-description** (e.g., `hotfix/HS-456-fix-login-error`)
- **release/v[version]** (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`)

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code functionality (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
- `feat(auth): implement JWT authentication`
- `fix(api): resolve null pointer in user controller`
- `docs: update API documentation`

### Commit Best Practices

- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change
- Write clear, concise commit messages (50 characters or less for the subject line)
- Reference issue IDs in commit messages where applicable

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Create a branch from the appropriate base (usually `develop`)
2. Make your changes in small, logical commits
3. Push your branch to the remote repository
4. Open a pull request with a clear description
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge using squash or rebase (as appropriate)

### PR Description Template

```
## Description

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## How Has This Been Tested?
[Description of testing approach]

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
```

## Git Best Practices

- Pull and rebase frequently to minimize merge conflicts
- Use `git rebase` to maintain a clean commit history
- Never force push to shared branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`)
- Use interactive rebase to clean up commits before opening a PR
- Delete branches after they've been merged

## Tagging and Releases

- Tag all releases with semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- Create annotated tags with release notes
- Follow semantic versioning principles (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

Remember that version control history serves as documentation for the project's evolution. Clear commit messages and a clean history make it easier for all team members to understand changes and their purpose.
