# Code Review Guidelines

Code reviews are a critical part of our development process, helping to maintain code quality, share knowledge, and catch issues early. This guide outlines our code review process and best practices.

## Core Principles

- **Technical correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Code quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
- **Consistency**: Does the code follow our established conventions and patterns?
- **Security**: Is the code free from vulnerabilities?
- **Performance**: Is the code efficient?

## The Review Process

### For Code Authors

1. **Keep changes small and focused**
   - Limit PRs to ~200-400 lines of code when possible
   - One PR should address one concern or feature
   - Break large features into smaller, reviewable chunks

2. **Provide context**
   - Write clear PR descriptions explaining what and why (not just how)
   - Link to relevant tickets or requirements
   - Highlight areas where you'd like specific feedback

3. **Self-review**
   - Review your own diff before requesting reviews
   - Run tests and linters locally before submitting
   - Consider annotating your PR with comments to explain complex sections

4. **Be responsive**
   - Address feedback promptly
   - If you disagree with feedback, discuss constructively

### For Reviewers

1. **Be timely**
   - Aim to review PRs within 24 hours of being assigned
   - For large PRs, acknowledge receipt and provide an ETA

2. **Focus on what matters**
   - Prioritize correctness, security, and design issues
   - Don't let style and nit-picks overshadow more important concerns
   - Remember that perfect is the enemy of good

3. **Be constructive**
   - Explain why something should be changed
   - Provide examples or links to relevant documentation
   - Use phrases like "Consider..." or "What if we..."

4. **Be explicit about expectations**
   - Clearly indicate if a comment is a blocker or just a suggestion
   - Use labels like "Nit:" for minor style suggestions

## Review Checklist

### Functionality
- Does the code work as expected?
- Are all edge cases handled?
- Are there appropriate tests?
- Is error handling comprehensive?

### Code Quality
- Is the code readable and well-organized?
- Does it follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles?
- Are functions and methods focused on a single responsibility?
- Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?

### Security
- Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are authentication and authorization implemented correctly?
- Are there any potential injection vulnerabilities?
- Is sensitive data handled securely?

### Performance
- Are there any obvious performance issues?
- Are database queries optimized?
- Is caching used appropriately?
- Could any operations be batched or optimized?

### Documentation
- Are public APIs documented?
- Are complex algorithms or business logic explained?
- Are there comments explaining "why" not just "what"?

## Resolving Disagreements

1. Focus on data and objectives rather than personal preferences
2. Refer to established guidelines and principles
3. Consider prototyping alternatives if there's disagreement about approach
4. If necessary, involve a third team member to provide perspective
5. Remember that progress is often more important than perfection

## Mindset

Code reviews should be a collaborative learning experience, not just a quality gate. Approach reviews with empathy, knowing that everyone is working toward the same goal of creating excellent software.

Good code reviews lead to better code, increased knowledge sharing, and a stronger team culture.
