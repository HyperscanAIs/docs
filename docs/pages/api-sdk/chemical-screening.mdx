Identify hazardous materials in cargo and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Hyperscan's chemical screening API leverages AI to detect potential risks, check compatibility, and generate detailed compliance reports.

## Features

- **Hazard Detection**: Detect hazardous chemicals using AI-powered models.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Verify chemical compatibility based on international safety standards.
- **Compliance Checks**: Ensure adherence to transportation and storage regulations.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate comprehensive screening and compatibility reports.
- **Batch Screening**: Analyze multiple cargo items in a single request.
- **Customizable Rules**: Define custom screening rules based on specific business needs.

## Input

The chemical screening API requires the following inputs:

- **Cargo ID**: A unique identifier for the cargo item.
- **Material Composition**: A list of chemicals or materials present in the cargo.
- **Weight** (optional): The weight of the cargo for context in screening.
- **Storage Conditions** (optional): Information about storage conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
- **Custom Rules** (optional): User-defined rules for screening and compatibility checks.

### Example Input (JSON)
```json
{
  "cargoId": "cargo-id-123",
  "materialComposition": ["flammable gas", "oxidizing agent"],
  "weight": 1500,
  "storageConditions": {
    "temperature": "ambient",
    "humidity": "low"
  },
  "customRules": {
    "prohibitedCombinations": [
      { "chemicalA": "flammable gas", "chemicalB": "oxidizing agent" }
    ],
    "maxAllowedWeight": 2000
  }
}
```

## Output

The API returns a screening result along with compatibility and compliance details:

- **Screening Result**: Indicates whether the cargo is safe or hazardous.
- **Detected Hazards**: A list of hazardous materials or conditions identified.
- **Compatibility Status**: Indicates whether the materials are compatible for storage or transport.
- **Compliance Status**: Indicates whether the cargo complies with specified regulations.
- **Warnings** (optional): Any issues or anomalies detected during the screening process.

### Example Output (JSON)
```json
{
  "screeningResult": "hazardous",
  "detectedHazards": ["flammable gas", "oxidizing agent"],
  "compatibilityStatus": "incompatible",
  "complianceStatus": "non-compliant",
  "warnings": ["Incompatible materials: flammable gas and oxidizing agent"]
}
```

## Supported Features

- **Real-Time Screening**: Analyze cargo in real-time for operational efficiency.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Verify chemical compatibility based on the provided chart.
- **Batch Processing**: Screen multiple cargo items in a single API call.
- **Customizable Rules**: Define prohibited combinations, weight limits, and other constraints.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to international safety standards.
- **Error Handling**: Detect and handle anomalies in input data.

## Chemical Compatibility

The API uses a compatibility matrix to determine whether materials can be stored or transported together. Key compatibility statuses include:

- **OK to Store Together**: Materials are safe to store together.
- **Segregate**: Materials must be stored separately by a specified distance (e.g., 3m or 5m).
- **Isolate**: Materials must be completely isolated from each other.
- **Check MSDS**: Compatibility depends on specific material safety data sheets (MSDS).

### Example Compatibility Check
If the cargo contains "flammable gas" and "oxidizing agent," the API will return a compatibility status of "incompatible" with a warning to isolate the materials.

## Outcomes

- **Enhanced Safety**: Identify hazardous materials and incompatible combinations to prevent accidents.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Avoid fines and legal issues by adhering to safety standards.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamline the screening and compatibility checking process.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce risks associated with transporting or storing hazardous materials.

## Disadvantages

- **Dependency on Input Data**: Requires accurate material composition and storage condition data for optimal results.
- **Custom Rule Complexity**: Defining and maintaining custom rules may require additional effort.
- **Edge Cases**: Uncommon materials or combinations may result in lower confidence scores.
- **API Latency**: Large-scale batch screening requests may take longer to process.
