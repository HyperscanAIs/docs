# Delivery Time Estimation

Estimate delivery times based on traffic, distance, and other factors. Hyperscan's delivery time estimation API provides accurate predictions to optimize logistics operations.

## Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Predict delivery times with high precision.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Adjust estimates based on live traffic data.
- **Custom Parameters**: Include factors like weather, vehicle type, and road conditions.
- **Batch Estimation**: Estimate delivery times for multiple routes in a single request.

## Input

The delivery time estimation API requires the following inputs:

- **Origin**: The starting point of the delivery route.
- **Destination**: The endpoint of the delivery route.
- **Waypoints** (optional): A list of intermediate stops along the route.
- **Vehicle Specifications** (optional): Details such as speed, fuel efficiency, and type.
- **Traffic Data** (optional): Real-time traffic conditions for the route.

### Example Input (JSON)
```json
{
  "origin": "Warehouse A",
  "destination": "Customer B",
  "waypoints": ["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
  "vehicle": {
    "type": "truck",
    "averageSpeed": 60
  },
  "trafficData": {
    "congestionLevel": "moderate"
  }
}
```

## Output

The API returns the following details:

- **Estimated Time**: The predicted delivery time for the route.
- **Distance**: The total distance of the route.
- **Traffic Impact**: The impact of traffic conditions on the estimated time.
- **Warnings** (optional): Any issues or anomalies detected during the estimation process.

### Example Output (JSON)
```json
{
  "estimatedTime": "2 hours 30 minutes",
  "distance": "150 km",
  "trafficImpact": "15 minutes delay due to moderate congestion",
  "warnings": ["Waypoints not optimized for shortest route"]
}
```

## Supported Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Integration**: Incorporates live traffic data to improve accuracy.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust predictions based on vehicle type, speed, and road conditions.
- **Batch Processing**: Estimate delivery times for multiple routes simultaneously.
- **Error Handling**: Detect and handle anomalies in input data.

## Outcomes

- **Improved Planning**: Optimize delivery schedules with accurate time predictions.
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction**: Provide reliable delivery time estimates to customers.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce delays and improve resource allocation.
- **Cost Optimization**: Avoid unnecessary fuel consumption and overtime costs.

## Disadvantages

- **Dependency on Traffic Data**: Requires accurate and up-to-date traffic data for optimal results.
- **Complexity for Multi-Stop Routes**: Estimations for routes with many waypoints may require additional processing time.
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual road conditions or weather events may reduce prediction accuracy.

## API Examples

### JavaScript
```javascript
client.estimateDeliveryTime({
  origin: "Warehouse A",
  destination: "Customer B",
  waypoints: ["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
  vehicle: {
    type: "truck",
    averageSpeed: 60
  },
  trafficData: {
    congestionLevel: "moderate"
  }
}).then(result => {
  console.log(`Estimated Time: ${result.estimatedTime}`);
  console.log(`Distance: ${result.distance}`);
  console.log(`Traffic Impact: ${result.trafficImpact}`);
  if (result.warnings) {
    console.warn(`Warnings: ${result.warnings.join(", ")}`);
  }
});
```

### Python
```python
result = client.estimate_delivery_time(
    origin="Warehouse A",
    destination="Customer B",
    waypoints=["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
    vehicle={"type": "truck", "averageSpeed": 60},
    traffic_data={"congestionLevel": "moderate"}
)
print(f"Estimated Time: {result['estimatedTime']}")
print(f"Distance: {result['distance']}")
print(f"Traffic Impact: {result['trafficImpact']}")
if "warnings" in result:
    print(f"Warnings: {', '.join(result['warnings'])}")
```

### Dart
```dart
final result = await client.estimateDeliveryTime(
  origin: "Warehouse A",
  destination: "Customer B",
  waypoints: ["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
  vehicle: {"type": "truck", "averageSpeed": 60},
  trafficData: {"congestionLevel": "moderate"},
);
print('Estimated Time: ${result.estimatedTime}');
print('Distance: ${result.distance}');
print('Traffic Impact: ${result.trafficImpact}');
if (result.warnings != null) {
  print('Warnings: ${result.warnings.join(", ")}');
}
```
