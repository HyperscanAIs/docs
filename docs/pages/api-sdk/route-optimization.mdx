# Route Optimization

Optimize delivery routes to minimize travel time and fuel consumption. Hyperscan's route optimization API leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data to provide efficient routing solutions for logistics operations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Optimization**: Adjust routes based on real-time traffic data and road conditions.
- **Multi-Stop Planning**: Plan routes with multiple waypoints for complex delivery schedules.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce fuel consumption and delivery times, improving overall operational efficiency.
- **Custom Constraints**: Support for custom constraints such as vehicle capacity, delivery time windows, and priority stops.

## Input

The route optimization API requires the following inputs:

- **Origin**: The starting point of the route (e.g., warehouse location).
- **Destination**: The endpoint of the route (e.g., customer delivery address).
- **Waypoints** (optional): A list of intermediate stops along the route.
- **Vehicle Specifications** (optional): Details such as vehicle capacity, fuel efficiency, and type.
- **Constraints** (optional): Custom constraints like delivery time windows, maximum distance, or priority stops.

### Example Input (JSON)
```json
{
  "origin": "Warehouse A",
  "destination": "Customer B",
  "waypoints": ["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
  "vehicle": {
    "capacity": 1000,
    "type": "truck"
  },
  "constraints": {
    "timeWindows": [
      { "stop": "Stop 1", "start": "09:00", "end": "10:00" },
      { "stop": "Stop 2", "start": "11:00", "end": "12:00" }
    ],
    "priorityStops": ["Stop 1"]
  }
}
```

## Output

The API returns an optimized route with the following details:

- **Path**: The sequence of stops along the route.
- **Estimated Time**: The total estimated travel time for the route.
- **Distance**: The total distance covered by the route.
- **Fuel Consumption** (optional): Estimated fuel usage based on vehicle specifications.
- **Warnings** (optional): Any constraints or conditions that could not be satisfied.

### Example Output (JSON)
```json
{
  "path": ["Warehouse A", "Stop 1", "Stop 2", "Customer B"],
  "estimatedTime": "3 hours 15 minutes",
  "distance": "120 km",
  "fuelConsumption": "15 liters",
  "warnings": ["Stop 2 time window partially satisfied"]
}
```

## Supported Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Integration**: Incorporates live traffic data to avoid congested areas.
- **Customizable Constraints**: Supports constraints like time windows, vehicle capacity, and priority stops.
- **Multi-Vehicle Optimization**: Optimize routes for multiple vehicles in a fleet.
- **Geofencing**: Avoid restricted areas or zones during route planning.
- **API Scalability**: Handle large-scale route optimization requests for enterprise operations.

## Outcomes

- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduce delivery times and operational costs.
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction**: Meet delivery time windows and improve reliability.
- **Reduced Environmental Impact**: Minimize fuel consumption and emissions.
- **Scalability**: Support for complex logistics operations with multiple vehicles and stops.

## Disadvantages

- **Dependency on Data Accuracy**: Requires accurate input data (e.g., traffic, road conditions) for optimal results.
- **Complexity for Small Operations**: May be overkill for small-scale logistics operations with simple routes.
- **Constraint Limitations**: Some constraints (e.g., highly specific delivery windows) may not always be fully satisfied.
- **API Latency**: Large-scale optimization requests with many constraints may take longer to process.

## API Examples

### JavaScript
```javascript
client.optimizeRoute({
  origin: "Warehouse A",
  destination: "Customer B",
  waypoints: ["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
  vehicle: {
    capacity: 1000,
    type: "truck"
  },
  constraints: {
    timeWindows: [
      { stop: "Stop 1", start: "09:00", end: "10:00" },
      { stop: "Stop 2", start: "11:00", end: "12:00" }
    ],
    priorityStops: ["Stop 1"]
  }
}).then(route => {
  console.log(`Optimized Route: ${route.path}`);
  console.log(`Estimated Time: ${route.estimatedTime}`);
  console.log(`Distance: ${route.distance}`);
  console.log(`Fuel Consumption: ${route.fuelConsumption}`);
  if (route.warnings) {
    console.warn(`Warnings: ${route.warnings.join(", ")}`);
  }
});
```

### Python
```python
route = client.optimize_route(
    origin="Warehouse A",
    destination="Customer B",
    waypoints=["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
    vehicle={
        "capacity": 1000,
        "type": "truck"
    },
    constraints={
        "timeWindows": [
            {"stop": "Stop 1", "start": "09:00", "end": "10:00"},
            {"stop": "Stop 2", "start": "11:00", "end": "12:00"}
        ],
        "priorityStops": ["Stop 1"]
    }
)
print(f"Optimized Route: {route['path']}")
print(f"Estimated Time: {route['estimated_time']}")
print(f"Distance: {route['distance']}")
print(f"Fuel Consumption: {route['fuel_consumption']}")
if "warnings" in route:
    print(f"Warnings: {', '.join(route['warnings'])}")
```

### Dart
```dart
final route = await client.optimizeRoute(
  origin: "Warehouse A",
  destination: "Customer B",
  waypoints: ["Stop 1", "Stop 2"],
  vehicle: {
    "capacity": 1000,
    "type": "truck"
  },
  constraints: {
    "timeWindows": [
      {"stop": "Stop 1", "start": "09:00", "end": "10:00"},
      {"stop": "Stop 2", "start": "11:00", "end": "12:00"}
    ],
    "priorityStops": ["Stop 1"]
  },
);
print('Optimized Route: ${route.path}');
print('Estimated Time: ${route.estimatedTime}');
print('Distance: ${route.distance}');
print('Fuel Consumption: ${route.fuelConsumption}');
if (route.warnings != null) {
  print('Warnings: ${route.warnings.join(", ")}');
}
